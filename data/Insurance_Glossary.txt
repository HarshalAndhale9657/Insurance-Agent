1. Premium (Kishth):
The amount you pay to the insurance company to buy the policy. It is like buying a ticket to safety. You can pay it yearly (annually), half-yearly, or monthly.

2. Sum Assured (Bima Rashi):
The total amount of money the insurance company promises to pay your family if something happens to you (like death or accident). 
Example: If you buy a policy with a Sum Assured of 5 Lakhs, your family gets 5 Lakhs.

3. Beneficiary (Nominee):
The person you choose to receive the money if you are not there. This is usually your wife, husband, or children. It is very important to name a nominee.

4. Term Insurance:
A low-cost policy that gives a large amount of money to your family ONLY if you pass away during the policy period. If you survive, you get nothing back, but your family was safe for all those years. It is the cheapest and most important insurance.

5. Endowment Plan:
A policy that gives you money back if you survive the term, AND gives money to your family if you pass away. The premium is higher than Term Insurance because it has a savings component.

6. Claim (Daawa):
The request your family makes to the insurance company to get the money when an unfortunate event happens.

7. Policy Term:
The number of years the insurance policy is active. If you buy a 10-year policy, you are protected for 10 years.

8. Grace Period:
Extra time given to pay your premium after the due date (usually 15-30 days). If you pay within this time, your policy continues without stopping.

9. Exclusions:
Things that are NOT covered by the policy. For example, suicide in the first year is usually an exclusion.

10. Rider (Add-on):
Extra benefits you can add to your basic policy for a small extra cost. 
Example: 'Accidental Death Benefit Rider' gives extra money if death happens due to an accident.
